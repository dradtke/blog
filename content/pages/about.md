Welcome to my blog!

I'm Damien, a software developer based in Chicago. This website is my place for occasionally writing
blog posts, usually around programming. They're not always interesting or useful, but hey, it's
about the journey, right?

My programming interests lately include

1. Go and Rust
2. Networking infrastructure
3. Desktop application development with GTK

Because I like to think of myself as a well-rounded person, some of my non-programming interests
include

1. Cats
2. Coffee
3. Spicy food
4. Whisky and Beer

The name of this blog is a reference to the opening line of Toxicity by System of a Down, and if you
got the reference already, then congratulations, you are my favorite reader. ðŸŒŸ
